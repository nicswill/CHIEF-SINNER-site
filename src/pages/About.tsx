        <p className="mb-4">
          Chief Sinner was founded by musical artist AC Sinner as a bold expression of truth—we are all SINNERS saved by GRACE. This brand exists to remind us that it's not about perfection, but transformation.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Crafted from quality materials and grounded in simple yet powerful designs, each piece reflects a deeper message: Amazing grace, how sweet the sound, that saved a WRETCH like me—not a perfect person, but a WRETCH in need of AMAZING GRACE!
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Our mission is not to claim perfection, but to pursue a life of faith—walking daily by the power of Ruach HaKodesh (Holy Spirit)—so that over time Adoni might make us sin less, until one day we stand sin-less in His presence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just as Yeshua transformed Shaul (Paul)—a chief sinner—on the road to Damascus, we believe that same grace is available to you and me. It’s not by works, but by FAITH and FAITH alone. This is more than apparel—it’s a declaration.
